			</ol>
			<h3>Task 2 Tips</h3>
			<p>For Task 2, go to Assessments. Go to Task Two and click on VIEW TASK to view its requirements and scroll down to the bottom 
			to read the attachment called “Implementation Email” and the second attachment called “Implementation Meeting”, which requires 
			watching a ﬁve-minute video. <mark>The most common reasons students don’t pass Task Two is because they forget to include all 
			required information.</mark></p>
			<p>
				Requirements A1 & A3 ask for a discussion.  A discussion must be a complete and thorough discussion that must be more than 
				one single sentence.  A suggestion would be to write at least 3 or more sentences.

			<h3>Scenario</h3>
			<p>You were recently hired as the implementation team lead for Seamus Company. After completing your orientation and onboarding period, you are assigned as the point of contact on a company-wide equipment upgrade project that has been delayed once already. Your supervisor, Kamal, who also serves as the committee chair of the project, is looking to you to get this project launched quickly and effectively. While there are over a dozen teams on your list to upgrade, you have proposed an initial, single-team rollout to pilot your implementation plan and resolve any unforeseen issues in that plan. 
			You asked Kamal to select the best team for your pilot rollout. Kamal identified two potential teams and scheduled a meeting with the team 
			managers and a data analyst to decide which team should be prioritized for the equipment upgrades. This is a critical decision that your team 
			is waiting on to start planning. You were unable to attend the meeting due to a schedule conflict, but you are able to view the recording.</p>

			<p>Since you are new to the organization, you have not yet built relationships with any of the people who attended the meeting. 
			Kamal recorded the meeting and shared it, along with the meeting minutes, via email. You also see that Diego, the manager of Team A, 
			requested time to meet with you one on one. While the project is behind schedule and you have only been assigned to this role for one 
			week, you cannot move forward with planning until you know which team to prioritize in the rollout. Following the events of the initial 
			meeting, you are tasked with analyzing the meeting and recommending opportunities for improvement to be communicated to your team.</p>
