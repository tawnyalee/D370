			<h1>D370 Task 2</h1>
				<p>For Task 2, you must watch a short video and read an email that is linked at the bottom of the task requirements page. To access these, go to Assessments. Click on Task Two and select VIEW TASK to view its requirements. Scroll down to the bottom 
			to read the attachment called “Implementation Email” and the second attachment called “Implementation Meeting”, which requires 
			watching a ﬁve-minute video. <b>The two most common reasons students don’t pass Task Two is:</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li>They forget to include all required information.</li>
				<li> They misunderstand section A4. Section A4 asks you to write what method you'd use to let your team know to expect the changes you discuss
				in A3. It is not a discussion of how you would implement A3.</li>
			</ol> 
			<p>
			<p>The process: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Review the scenario, the web link, and the supporting document provided in the task.</li>
				<li><a href="Task2ResponseGuide.docx" target="_blank" alt="Word Document with Response Guide for Task 2">
					Download Task 2 Response Guide and use it when you start writing.</a></li>
				<li>Provide a written response to the prompts for Task 2 using the Response Guide as a template and the directions below to understand the task requirements.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Task 2 Requirements:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Discuss <b>two</b> examples of effective communication in either the meeting video or the implementation email. Include why it is an example of good communication.</li>
				<li>Identify <b>two</b> opportunities for improvement in communication in either the meeting video or the implementation email. Don't stop at telling the reader what went wrong.
				Instead, focus on what could be done to improve the 2 examples of what went wrong.</li>
				<li> Discuss <b>two</b> communication improvements you would make as a team leader in the meeting video or implementation email. 
					Think of how you can improve communication when you work with the team moving forward based on what you’ve seen in their interactions 
					through the email and video. What will YOU do as a leader to improve things? This could be anything from setting clear expectations prior to the meeting with an agenda, 
					to improving your active listening skills. You need to provide TWO improvements.</li>
				<li>In A4, you explain how you would communicate those improvements from A3 to the team. You need a different method for each change you listed in A3. Here are my examples of a method of communicating the change and the reasoning behind it:</li>
			</ol>
				<p style="margin-left: 50px;">I would conduct a brief team meeting to discuss the communication improvements and gather feedback from team members. This method allows for open dialogue and ensures everyone understands the rationale behind the changes. 
					Team meetings provide a valuable opportunity for face-to-face interaction and open discussion, which can help build trust and 
					foster a collaborative environment.</p>
</p>
			<h3>Task 2 Tips</h3>
			
			</p>Use the Response Guide linked above to prevent forgetting to add all necessary information. <br /><br />Requirements A1 & A3 ask for a discussion.  A discussion must be a complete and thorough discussion that must be more than 
				one single sentence.  A suggestion would be to write at least 3 or more sentences. <br /><br />In A4, come up with two <b>distinct</b> methods (email, meetings, newsletters, etc.) for 
				how you'd inform the team of the upcoming changes mentioned in A3.
