				<li>Provide a written response to the prompts in Section A for Task 2 using the Response Guide as a template and the Task 2 Directions to understand the task requirements.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Task 2 Requirements:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Discuss <b>two</b> examples of effective communication in either the meeting video or the implementation email.</li>
				<li>Identify <b>two</b> opportunities for improvement in communication in either the meeting video or the implementation email.</li>
				<li> Discuss <b>two</b> communication improvements you would make as a team leader in the meeting video or implementation email.</li>
				<li>Describe <b>two</b> different methods you would use to communicate the improvements from part A3 to your team. Include your reasoning for choosing each method.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Task 2 Tips</h3>
			<p>For Task 2, go to Assessments. Click on Task Two and select VIEW TASK to view its requirements. Scroll down to the bottom 
			to read the attachment called “Implementation Email” and the second attachment called “Implementation Meeting”, which requires 
			watching a ﬁve-minute video. <mark>The two most common reasons students don’t pass Task Two is: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>They forget to include all required information.</li>
				<li> They misunderstand section A4. Section A4 asks you to write what method you'd use to let your team know to expect the changes you discuss
				in A3. It is not a discussion of how you would implement A3.</li>
			</ol> 
			<p>
				Use the Response Guide linked above to prevent forgetting to add all necessary information. <br /><br />Requirements A1 & A3 ask for a discussion.  A discussion must be a complete and thorough discussion that must be more than 
				one single sentence.  A suggestion would be to write at least 3 or more sentences. <br /><br />In A4, come up with two <b>distinct</b> methods (email, meetings, newsletters, etc.) for 
				how you'd inform the team of the upcoming changes mentioned in A3.
