			<p>To pass this course, you must complete two tasks. In your first task, you must complete the following: 
			
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Take the Clifton's Strenths Assessment.</li>

				<li>Discuss one leadership goal that would improve your leadership and two actions you can take to support that goal.</li>

			</p>
			<ol>

			</ol>
			<h2>Course Tips</h2>
			<p>Answer all questions using complete sentences and then group the sentences into short paragraphs.  
				If using multiple paragraphs, skip one blank line between them.
			</p>
			<p>The most common reasons students don’t pass this course is they forget to include all requirements. 
				Be sure to go in the Course of Study and review the scenario in the task details for each task as well as the directions. 
				The task directions are also copied onto each task page on this study guide, but you will still need to review the scenario 
				in the Course of Study. 
				<mark>Use complete sentences and/or descriptive paragraphs. </mark>
			</p>
			<p><bold>BEFORE YOU SUBMIT…..USE GRAMMARLY</bold>
				****I can’t stress it enough to use the desktop version of Grammarly.com. 
				The Chrome App is okay but some students still end up with revisions.****
