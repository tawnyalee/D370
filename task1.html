			<p>The process:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Take the CliftonStrenths Assessment.</li>
				<li><a href="D370Task1.docx" target="_blank" alt="Word Document with Directions for Task 1">
					Download Task 1 Directions and refer to it as you complete the remaining steps.</a></li>
				<li>Provide written responses to questions regarding your results from CliftonStrengths.</li>
				<li>Discuss one leadership goal that would improve your leadership and two actions you can take to support that goal.</li>
				<li>Read the provided scenario and respond based on the prompts of section C.</li>
			</ol>
			
				<h3>Section A Requirements:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Provide a PDF of your completed CliftonStrengths self-assessment. The evidence must show your name and all five strengths.</li>
							<li>Discuss the results of the five categorical strengths from the CliftonStrengths self-assessment, including what those results indicate about your leadership.</li>
							<li>Explain how each of your five identified strengths from the CliftonStrengths self-assessment influence your thoughts, 
								decisions, and behaviors as the IT manager in the provided scenario.</li>
					</ol>
				<p><em>Note: The IT leadership goal should focus on improving your leadership, not on improving your team.</em></p>
				<h3>Section A Tips:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>First, go to your Student Degree Plan, click on IT Leadership Foundations course. 
					On the landing page of the Course of Study, go to the bottom center section called Assessments and go to 
					<b>Task One</b>, and to the right of it, click on <b>View Task</b>.</li>
					<li>On the next screen, scroll to the <b>BOTTOM</b> and take the CliftonStrengths Assessment. The Requirements Section for Task One are at the top of the same page, above the CliftonStrengths test. If you have any issues clicking
					on the CliftonStrength Assessment or retrieving the results please review
					<a href="https://srm--c.vf.force.com/apex/CourseArticle?id=kA0S600000010FhKAI&groupId=&searchTerm=&courseCode=D370&rtn=/apex/CommonsExpandedSearch" target="_blank">this article.</a>
					</li>
					<li>The CliftonStrengths Assessment is not dependent on the Course Material. Once you complete the CliftonStrenghts Assessment, the most 
					relevant chapters to read in the Course Material, are Chapters 1, 2 & 3 in Section One, 7 & 8 in Section Two, and Chapters 
					11, 14 & 15 in Section Three. These are suggested readings, you may not need them to complete the tasks.</li>
					<li>Supportive resources are not required for task 1 or task 2, but if you do use them you will 
					need to include an in-text citation and a matching reference in the reference section.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Section B Requirements:</h3>
				<ol>	
					<li>Discuss one IT leadership goal that will help improve your leadership as the IT manager in the scenario (shared below).</li>
					<li>Discuss two specific actions you will take to support the goal discussed in part B.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Section B Tips</h3>
				<p>Please see Readings and Resources under Section 1: Leadership Strategies in the Course Materials (yellow button in course of study) for more information on How to write SMART goals, 
				this will provide some guidance for writing the IT Leadership goal. The IT leadership goal is something that will help you 
				improve your leadership. A key is to describe the outcome of the leadership goal as it relates to improving your leadership. 
				Once you have written your IT Leadership goal, send it to your assigned instructor before submitting for pointers on providing 
				all that is needed to meet the requirements.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The most common reason students do not pass Task One section B is <mark>the leadership goal must relate to the scenario</mark> 
					and the goal must discuss how you, the learner, acting as the IT Manager, can improve your own personal leadership skills 
					<b>on your own “without” the help of their team.</b>Part B is about how to improve <em>your own personal leadership,</em> NOT how to 
					improve the team. Example: "I will improve my active listening skills to better understand the meaning of what others say."</li>
					<li>Give two (2) actions to improve your active listening skills.  The actions must be individual actions and not involve the team.
						Example: "I will attend a webinar about active listening skills and I will read six articles online about improving active listening skills."</li>			
				</ol>
				<h3>Section C Requirements:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>C. Select two of the key issues identified in the provided scenario. Recommend a different leadership style for each issue, and explain 
					how your chosen leadership style effectively addresses the issues. 
					Leadership styles can include, but are not limited to, transformational, servant, spiritual, autocratic, or authentic leadership.</li>
					<li>C1.Describe how applying both leadership styles from part C would motivate the team. Provide two approaches for each style.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Section C Tips:</h3>
				<p>Read the directions very carefully for this section. You need to choose two of the key issues in the scenario and then recommend 
				a leadership style for each issue. You will need to describe how the leadership styles will motivate the team and provide two ways 
				or approaches that will be taken for each of the styles. All of these items must be present to pass.</p>
				<h3>Scenario</h3>
				<p>You are the IT manager at Innovatech Solutions, a midsized software development company. Your team consists of 20 
				employees, including the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>experienced developers (8): senior-level professionals with 10+ years of experience</li>
					<li>junior developers (6): entry-level developers with fewer than 2 years of experience, eager to learn but lacking deep expertise</li>
					<li>remote workers (4): a mix of senior and junior developers working from various locations, facing communication and coordination challenges</li>
					<li>project coordinators (2): responsible for overseeing project timelines and ensuring team alignment</li>					
				</ul>
				<p>Recently, Innovatech Solutions has decided to adopt new processes to improve project delivery times and increase 
				flexibility in responding to client needs. This decision came after a significant project was delayed due to inefficiencies. 
				The transition has caused resistance among team members, particularly with the experienced developers who prefer the predictability
				and structure of the traditional approach.<br />Key issues identified: </p>

				<ul>
					<li>resistance to change: Experienced developers are skeptical about the new processes, fearing it may disrupt their workflow and reduce productivity.</li>
					<li>communication gaps: Remote workers often feel left out of important discussions, leading to misalignment and delays.</li>
					<li>skill gaps: Junior developers need additional training to adapt to the new processes.</li>
					<li>project coordination: Project coordinators are struggling to manage the transition while keeping projects on track.</li>
				</ul>
